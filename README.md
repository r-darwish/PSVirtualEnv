# PSVirtualEnv
        The module PSVirtualEnv is a set of powershell extensions to Ian Bickingâ€™s virtualenv tool in python. The module includes wrappers for creating and deleting virtual environments and otherwise managing your development workflow, making it easier to work on more than one project at a time without introducing conflicts in their dependencies.
